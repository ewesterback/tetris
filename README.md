### *Description*
This is a web-based browser tetris game to aid with anxiety as a form of distraction.  The launch page contains links to the tetris study and to the game.  The objective of tetris is to clear rows by filling the entire row.  Once no more shapes can enter the board, the game is over.  The left and right arrow keys move the shapes left to right, the up arrow rotates the pieces, and the down arrow drops pieces.  One a row has been filled, that row disappears and the score increases.
